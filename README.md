# flask-fundamentum

[Publication Revision 1]

##This is a Python Flask foundation web development package. It contains a basic root template with commonly used style sheets and various useful third party JavaScript libraries.

This small foundation project was inspired the frustration of starting new projects without a personal base to work from. As a junior or even student developer, habits such as project templates are great for reducing tedious efforts such as finding packages to link to a project, maintaining versions in templates etc...

Additionally, as the content pack grows, developers may be exposed to libraries unbeknownst to them. This is a great boost for third party development efforts. Support the ladies and gentlemen making the web a weird and wonderful place. Usage is contribution!
